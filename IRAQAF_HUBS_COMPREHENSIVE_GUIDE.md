## Overview

The IRAQAF platform consists of **7 specialized hub modules** plus 1 main dashboard that together provide comprehensive quality assurance, compliance monitoring, and regulatory oversight for AI systems. Each hub focuses on specific aspects of quality, security, compliance, and operational excellence.

### 🚀 Hub Navigation Order

The hubs follow a logical evaluation workflow that mirrors real-world AI governance processes:

1. **⚖️ L1 Regulations & Governance** - Every evaluation begins with compliance requirements
2. **🔐 L2 Privacy & Security** - Regulations lead into privacy/security requirements  
3. **⚖️ L3 Fairness & Ethics** - Sits between privacy and explainability as per frameworks
4. **🔍 L4 Explainability & Transparency** - AI Act places XAI after fairness & risk checks
5. **⚙️ System Operations & QA Monitor (SOQM)** - Infrastructure health check before aggregation
6. **📊 Unified QA Orchestrator (UQO)** - Top-level aggregator of all hubs
7. **🤖 Continuous Assurance Engine (CAE)** - Deep drift, anomaly, and internal CQS engine

#### 2. Group-Level Fairness Metrics

##### Demographic Parity Gap (DPG)
- **Definition:** Maximum difference in P(y_pred=1) between any two groups
- **Scale:** 0-1 (lower is better, 0 = perfect parity)
- **Formula:** max(P(positive | group_i)) - min(P(positive | group_j))
- **Threshold:** Gap < 0.05 (5%) indicates good demographic parity

##### Equal Opportunity Gap (EOG)
- **Definition:** Maximum difference in True Positive Rate (TPR) across groups
- **Scale:** 0-1 (lower is better)
- **Formula:** max(TPR | group_i) - min(TPR | group_j)
- **Threshold:** Gap < 0.05 (5%) indicates equal opportunity

##### Equalized Odds Gap (EOD)
- **Definition:** Maximum of (TPR gap, FPR gap) across groups
- **Scale:** 0-1 (lower is better)
- **Formula:** max(TPR_gap, FPR_gap)
- **Threshold:** Gap < 0.05 (5%) indicates equalized odds

##### Subgroup Accuracy Difference (SAD)
- **Definition:** Maximum accuracy difference across groups
- **Scale:** 0-1 (lower is better)
- **Formula:** max(accuracy | group_i) - min(accuracy | group_j)
- **Threshold:** Gap < 0.05 (5%) indicates consistent accuracy

#### 3. Ethical Maturity Level (EML)
- **Scale:** 1-5 (higher is better)

  - **Level 3 (40-60%):** Partially implemented
  - **Level 4 (60-80%):** Fully implemented
  - **Level 5 (80-100%):** Continuous optimization
- **Calculation:** Based on ethics checklist compliance:
  - Ethical policy documentation
  - Bias assessment (planned and regular)
  - Human oversight documentation
  - Incident reporting mechanisms
  - Fairness monitoring
  - Diverse testing data
  - Explainability requirements
  - User consent mechanisms

- **Components:**
  - Performance Drift (30%)
  - Fairness Drift (20%)
  - Security/Privacy (15%)
  - Compliance (20%)
  - System Health (15%)

## Integration & Workflow

### Typical Workflow
1. **Start Main Dashboard** (Port 8501) - Authenticate and get overview
2. **L1 Regulations & Governance** (Port 8504) - Begin with compliance requirements
3. **L2 Privacy & Security** (Port 8502) - Build on regulatory foundation
4. **L3 Fairness & Ethics** (Port 8506) - Evaluate fairness after security
5. **L4 Explainability & Transparency** (Port 5000) - Add transparency layer
6. **SOQM** (Port 8503) - Check infrastructure health
7. **UQO** (Port 8507) - See aggregated CQS across all hubs
8. **CAE** (Port 8508) - Monitor continuous assurance and drift
9. **Return to Main Dashboard** - Review aggregated GQAS

### Data Flow
```
Individual Hubs → UQO → Main Dashboard
                      ↓
              CAE (Parallel Monitoring)
```

### Cross-Hub Dependencies
- **UQO** requires all 5 hubs to be running
- **Main Dashboard** can function independently but shows aggregated data
- **CAE** operates independently but enhances UQO data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   - Check running processes: `netstat -ano | findstr :<port>`
   - Kill process or use different port

2. **Hub Not Responding**
   - Verify hub is running (check process list)
   - Check logs for errors
   - Verify dependencies are installed

3. **Authentication Issues**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check user credentials in `data/auth/users.json`
   - Verify authentication module is imported

4. **UQO Shows No Data**
   - Ensure all 5 hubs are running
   - Check hub URLs are correct
   - Wait 30 seconds for first poll

### Debug Mode
- Enable debug mode in Main Dashboard sidebar
- Check browser console for errors
- Review application logs in `logs/` directory
